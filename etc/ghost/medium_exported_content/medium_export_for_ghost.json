There are too many variables, especially at a company like Google where you are placed with 5-7 random software engineers and it\u2019s up to them to come up with an appropriate set of questions to ask, usually involving whiteboard coding. Some engineers are terrible interviewers, they ask unfair questions and create snap judgments. But that\u2019s OK, it happens to the best of us. You\u2019re generally allowed to flub a single interview in a panel.</p><p name=\"10ae\" id=\"10ae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The best I can do is tell you how you can be adequately prepared.

By coding, you\u2019re practicing. But the best practice is <em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">focused practice</em>. Have goals in mind, explore new areas, and challenge yourself. Over time, you should develop a portfolio of both unfinished and finished projects.

Ideally the language has a vibrant community, runs a lot of production code and is reasonably en vogue. Some good candidates are C#, C++, Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby.<br>There\u2019s a famous leading question that C++ interviewers like to ask other C++ programming candidates, <em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">\u201cOn a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest, how would you rank your knowledge of C++?\u201d </em>I hate this question.

And kudos to the CEO Bastian Lehmann for giving me and Ben the opportunity to run with it.</p><p name=\"6abc\" id=\"6abc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As a customer I felt the Postmates product wasn\u2019t iterating fast enough and knew that was the first thing I needed to dig into.</p><figure name=\"a805\" id=\"a805\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*qNJ7VVFR8zcavGBd.png\" data-width=\"248\" data-height=\"500\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qNJ7VVFR8zcavGBd.png\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Previous version</figcaption></figure><p name=\"9691\" id=\"9691\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The team was small and doing great work, but there were a few issues to be addressed:</p><p name=\"a2f6\" id=\"a2f6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Mobile engineers needed new processes and technology to make rapid development possible. Backend engineers needed to get out from under legacy, brittle systems slowing time to production. Frontend engineers wanted to use non-proprietary tools that were battle-hardened. And designers needed to work more closely with engineers in a way that was conducive to collaborative discovery.</p><p name=\"1a17\" id=\"1a17\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">All of the above needed to be addressed before we could focus entirely on building new products. Though we needed something to show for it in the end, because it\u2019s not enough to spend a couple quarters only addressing accrued technical and organization debt.</p><p name=\"e71b\" id=\"e71b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We quickly decided to redesign and relaunch the product with new features while also laying a new foundation for the team. It was an audacious goal but sometimes the best edit is a rewrite, and this was something we could rally around.</p><p name=\"44f3\" id=\"44f3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And it was imperative for the team to touch every view and page of the product, so we could move forward with the confidence of deeply understanding the entire service.</p><p name=\"49a9\" id=\"49a9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Within 6 months, we redesigned the entire product, built and deployed new critical services, devised new deployment and testing methodologies, and rewrote the entire mobile and web application from the ground up. Everything we needed to go full speed ahead.</p><figure name=\"4ebf\" id=\"4ebf\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*2O0DQLfrAvklscg2MsHjuQ@2x.png\" alt=\"Image result for postmates app\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2O0DQLfrAvklscg2MsHjuQ@2x.png\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">First redesign (Nov\u00a02017)</figcaption></figure><p name=\"a769\" id=\"a769\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The launch was a success and so we quickly went to work and shipped new products like Postmates Pickup and myriad other ways to answer the age-old question of \u201cwhat should I eat?\u201d with better search and recommendation engines.</p><p name=\"2703\" id=\"2703\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I want to directly call-out the design team\u2019s incredible work over the past year. The Postmates app is already world-class and can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next.</p><figure name=\"55e0\" id=\"55e0\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*N8Sj0Wk2_9nzJSDAeI0TPw.png\" data-width=\"1494\" data-height=\"1030\" data-is-featured=\"true\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*N8Sj0Wk2_9nzJSDAeI0TPw.png\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Recent version (May\u00a02018)</figcaption></figure><p name=\"acfb\" id=\"acfb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Combined with the exceptional work and execution by Merchant, Fleet, Support, Growth, Infrastructure and other teams, it all came together beautifully in 2018.</p><p name=\"4261\" id=\"4261\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Postmates <a href=\"https://blog.postmates.com/major-funding-growth-milestone-puts-postmates-on-new-trajectory-8d1bfa6922ba\" data-href=\"https://blog.postmates.com/major-funding-growth-milestone-puts-postmates-on-new-trajectory-8d1bfa6922ba\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently announced</a> a $300M funding round and is in a great position to continue its success in a massively lucrative market.</p><h4 name=\"2791\" id=\"2791\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">\ud83d\udc7b</h4><p name=\"2e25\" id=\"2e25\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">And so, after 15 months at Postmates and 18 years on the west coast, I desired a new challenge.</p><p name=\"b5d6\" id=\"b5d6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">I joined Snapchat in NYC. I love the product, its vision, and the team behind it. I couldn\u2019t be happier with the challenges and opportunities ahead.</p></div></div></section>\n</section>\n<footer><p>By <a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow\" class=\"p-author h-card\">David Byttow</a> on <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/aabdcdd27b64\"><time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2018-10-02T17:32:40.631Z\">October 2, 2018</time></a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/a-brief-reflection-on-my-time-at-postmates-aabdcdd27b64\" class=\"p-canonical\">Canonical link</a></p><p>Exported from <a href=\"https://medium.com\">Medium</a> on January 2, 2021.</p></footer></article></body></html>",

Often, there is no clear path forward and simply going with your gut is the right thing to do.</p><p name=\"824d\" id=\"824d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When you do listen to your instincts, make sure that you\u2019re making a robust decision that can stand the test of time. Your project will likely continue to go on after you\u2019ve moved on, you don\u2019t want your successors cursing your name when they inherit it. This often happens on projects that have accumulated a lot of technical debt.</p><p name=\"482b\" id=\"482b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When faced with making a decision against a set of options, I naturally go through the following process:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"5754\" id=\"5754\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Reduce the number of options to 2. The complexity of any problem increases exponentially with each option.</li><li name=\"7d30\" id=\"7d30\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Quickly determine if there is a clearly \u201cbest choice\u201d based on data available. But, don\u2019t be afraid to trust your gut!</li><li name=\"54b0\" id=\"54b0\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">If the answer is non-obvious, can it be redirected to someone who is better suited to make the decision?</li><li name=\"e825\" id=\"e825\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">If all else fails, then there may not be enough data or the wrong question is being asked. In this case, I make a gut decision and go with the one that is the most safe to try and doesn\u2019t move you backward.</li></ol><blockquote name=\"998d\" id=\"998d\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--li\">The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon, which enables it to strike and destroy its victim. -Sun Tzu</blockquote><p name=\"485f\" id=\"485f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">5. Show your work<br></strong>One of the most important aspects of a technical leader is that they are able to demonstrate it by example. We\u2019ve all heard the phrase \u201clead by example,\u201d but I prefer, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">show, don\u2019t tell</em>. By design, a tech lead is often not a manager because they focus their energy on code, not people. So, it\u2019s important to have the respect and trust of your team, which is best accomplished by demonstrating that you know your stuff.</p><p name=\"6dd8\" id=\"6dd8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Most leaders may find it hard to make time to write code, but it\u2019s extremely important that you try to find time. I call it inventing time. Even if I can spend a little bit of time doing \u201cgrunge work\u201d fixing annoying bugs or adding little helpful pieces of code here and there as needed, I will; it is more valuable to you than the code itself.</p><h3 name=\"0f52\" id=\"0f52\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Actions</h3><p name=\"c45d\" id=\"c45d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Below is a list of things that a tech lead often does to help move a project forward.

The fear comes in the form of not understanding my audience and writing something that doesn\u2019t resonate with them. To be honest, I feel this in a microcosmic form on Twitter, but perhaps more so with Medium because it feels more permanent and like it\u2019s meant to be more thoughtful.</p><blockquote name=\"1708\" id=\"1708\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Aside: Have you ever written a post that\u2019s received over 3,000 likes and then another that\u2019s gotten no more than 10?</blockquote><p name=\"927d\" id=\"927d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">I have and it feels kinda shitty. Why should anyone be made to feel so shitty for putting themselves out there in the form of creative expression?</p><p name=\"997f\" id=\"997f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My core issue stems from the fact that Medium is a <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">broadcast network</strong>. There is no (easy) way for me to narrowly cast on specific topics. For example, I would <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">love</strong> to publish more posts about nitty-gritty engineering topics that I experience on a daily basis\u200a\u2014\u200abut I have no clue how many of my followers want to hear about that. There are several other topics that I want to talk about, but I don\u2019t, because I just don\u2019t know my audience.</p><p name=\"1767\" id=\"1767\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">This is a really hard problem.</strong> As a former tech lead on Google+, I know it\u2019s not simply solved by organizing people into lists or by creating separate personas. Secret (RIP) turned the problem on its head by allowing you to take on any persona with every post as there was zero continuity between the posts you created. However, you were unable to build a following or cultivate an audience in that model.</p><p name=\"c899\" id=\"c899\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What I want is a robust <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">narrowcast</strong> network. Narrowcasting has been represented since the beginning of the Internet in the form of BBS\u2019s, forums and products like Reddit, because it keeps the content and conversation focused to topics. You know you\u2019re speaking with like-minded people.</p><p name=\"92cd\" id=\"92cd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I do believe (hope) there\u2019s a solution that gives us the ability to capture our own individual audiences while maintaining a single identity (or perhaps multiple identities) and even <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">make money \ud83d\udcb0 </strong>from it. This is something I\u2019ve been exploring a lot these days, between playing around both with a new kind of Secret product and some of the things we\u2019re working on with Bold.</p><p name=\"0fc4\" id=\"0fc4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I may not be the one to solve this problem, but I think it\u2019s incredibly important that we continue to have more <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">safe</strong> spaces to interact and share with others.</p><p name=\"8ee1\" id=\"8ee1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Am I missing something or silly for thinking in this way? <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">I\u2019m really curious what you think. \ud83d\udcad</strong></p><p name=\"060b\" id=\"060b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Tweet at me at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/davidbyttow\" data-href=\"http://twitter.com/davidbyttow\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://twitter.com/davidbyttow</a> or just email me at david.byttow@gmail.com or however you want to talk at me. \ud83d\udde3</p></div></div></section>\n</section>\n<footer><p>By <a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow\" class=\"p-author h-card\">David Byttow</a> on <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/6cc08cc18ca5\"><time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2017-01-11T08:36:38.915Z\">January 11, 2017</time></a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/my-current-issue-with-medium-6cc08cc18ca5\" class=\"p-canonical\">Canonical link</a></p><p>Exported from <a href=\"https://medium.com\">Medium</a> on January 2, 2021.</p></footer></article></body></html>",

You had an infinite amount of love to give, and you wanted to share it with others.</p><figure name=\"cb47\" id=\"cb47\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*VjNOYPMOibcDAsZs.jpeg\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"768\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*VjNOYPMOibcDAsZs.jpeg\"></figure><p name=\"d226\" id=\"d226\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">You tried to keep your eye on me at all times.

It was destroyed when the user left or backgrounded the app. Luckily, there were 3rd party Pusher protocol libraries (albeit we had to modify them) available for iOS and Android, which sped up development.</p><p name=\"35ad\" id=\"35ad\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In this image, there are two users (A and B) present in the same chat room.</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"840e\" id=\"840e\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">User A presses send on a message and a POST request is made to the Secret frontend with the chat id</li><li name=\"13e6\" id=\"13e6\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Server retrieves the chat session data, adds the message, and writes it back</li><li name=\"918d\" id=\"918d\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Server makes a POST request to Pusher with a payload intended for the client</li><li name=\"1e0f\" id=\"1e0f\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Pusher routes the message to User B via the websocket connection</li></ol><p name=\"9095\" id=\"9095\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Typing notifications and delivery receipts were very similar.</p><p name=\"ecca\" id=\"ecca\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In this model, although not perfect from a latency perspective, it was good enough and simple because requests only flowed in one direction: Client -&gt; Server -&gt; Pusher -&gt; Client</p><p name=\"9a58\" id=\"9a58\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It\u2019s also important to note that Pusher was only there for real-time notifications, not for canonical data. If at any time the user came back to the chat room, it would refresh the most recent state from the server and accept any new notifications from there. Analogous to rendering a single-page application and delivering changes to the client via AJAX or websocket.</p><h4 name=\"2292\" id=\"2292\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Code and\u00a0Model</h4><p name=\"07e2\" id=\"07e2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">The stored data model in the backend is simple. Secret\u2019s canonical datastore was Google App Engine\u2019s High-Replication Datastore (more on that in other blog posts). Essentially, it\u2019s a schema-less, NoSQL datastore built on top of BigTable and Megastore. Entities are document structure and stored in rows by a given key. There are no JOINs and query semantics are very limited, but it allows for very high read-throughput and wide scaling you\u2019d expect from a NoSQL offering.</p><figure name=\"7a7a\" id=\"7a7a\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*BTzkP0kzQYJzTXylZl6CCw.png\" data-width=\"1034\" data-height=\"804\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BTzkP0kzQYJzTXylZl6CCw.png\"></figure><p name=\"0367\" id=\"0367\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">When the user enters a chat room, an idempotent ID is created on the server that is effectively \u201c&lt;user1_id&gt;:&lt;user2_id&gt;:&lt;secret_id&gt;\u201d, also known as the chat session id. Important note: user ids in this key were always sorted (partial-ordering), guaranteeing idempotency. That way, given a pair of users and a secret, we can always generate the single ID for that secret.</p><p name=\"ceaa\" id=\"ceaa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Chat sessions are keyed by simple ids and contain the data above in a single row. Each time a chat is mutated, the server performs a transactional read-modify-write on the row. The transaction is fine so long as write throughput is kept to &lt;= 1 write/sec per entity.</p><p name=\"9069\" id=\"9069\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, when a user left a chat, we wanted to alert the recipient that they had done so. The server-side code looked like this:</p><figure name=\"c26e\" id=\"c26e\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*48ZaRW6LFADOftTt2m2zIQ.png\" data-width=\"1082\" data-height=\"622\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*48ZaRW6LFADOftTt2m2zIQ.png\"></figure><p name=\"54aa\" id=\"54aa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Pretty simple.</p><p name=\"c101\" id=\"c101\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For fast queries for things like showing the user all of their ongoing or previous chats, we created indexes on the participant and created time properties, allowing fast answers for things like \u201cFetch chats user X is a participant in sorted time in descending order\u201d and locally sorted by last update time. Because chats only lasted 24 hours since the last message exchange, we knew the number of chats would be a reasonably small number to fetch and sort locally on the server (e.g., &lt; 100 in almost every case). If they exceeded that, chances are the user was a bad actor and we could drop some on the floor. That code was simple:</p><figure name=\"5ae8\" id=\"5ae8\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*RTObyxGygknNNI-h-991jA.png\" data-width=\"1202\" data-height=\"680\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RTObyxGygknNNI-h-991jA.png\"></figure><p name=\"abc9\" id=\"abc9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Here\u2019s a small library I just open-sourced for talking directly to Pusher via Go (in App Engine environment). You can easily tweak this, the only tricky part of the entire process was authenticating the requests for private and presence channels. <a href=\"https://github.com/guitardave24/pusher-go-appengine/blob/master/pusher.go\" data-href=\"https://github.com/guitardave24/pusher-go-appengine/blob/master/pusher.go\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/guitardave24/pusher-go-appengine/blob/master/pusher.go</a></p><h4 name=\"187a\" id=\"187a\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Launch</h4><p name=\"6170\" id=\"6170\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">When we launched the redesign, chat was an instant hit. It grew week-over-week to well over 1,000,000 concurrent connections (chat + notifications). Luckily, Pusher worked well and was fairly inexpensive and our scaled linearly to a point where, assuming Pusher was able to meet our demand, we would have no issues for the foreseeable future.</p><p name=\"2010\" id=\"2010\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The key takeaways and reinforcements for me in this experience were:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"74dd\" id=\"74dd\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Start small and be ready to build a throw-away prototype to help force a decision</li><li name=\"76df\" id=\"76df\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">It\u2019s often unwise to roll your own implementation, no matter how fun it might be (obviously, but we all keep doing it!)</li></ul><p name=\"e72e\" id=\"e72e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">If I were to implement real-time chat in an app again, I\u2019d strongly consider using a simple model like this again. The downside of the above architecture is that it\u2019s not as fast as it could be (notably, because messages are routed through the Secret frontend to Pusher), but the end result was just fast, reliable and simple enough.</p><p name=\"f294\" id=\"f294\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Hopefully you found this interesting and/or useful, if you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to email me at <a href=\"mailto:d@secret.ly\" data-href=\"mailto:d@secret.ly\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">d@secret.ly</a> or follow me on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/davidbyttow\" data-href=\"http://twitter.com/davidbyttow\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" title=\"Twitter profile for @davidbyttow\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@davidbyttow</a></p><p name=\"399f\" id=\"399f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">David Byttow</p></div></div></section>\n</section>\n<footer><p>By <a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow\" class=\"p-author h-card\">David Byttow</a> on <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/d8589f8f0c9b\"><time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2015-05-12T21:51:31.553Z\">May 12, 2015</time></a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/scaling-secret-real-time-chat-d8589f8f0c9b\" class=\"p-canonical\">Canonical link</a></p><p>Exported from <a href=\"https://medium.com\">Medium</a> on January 2, 2021.</p></footer></article></body></html>",

At the time it last raised, Yik Yak had exploded across thousands of campuses in the US, propelling it to the top ranks in downloads on iOS and Android.</p><p name=\"4050\" id=\"4050\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here\u2019s the problem: Yik Yak rocketed because it was entertaining and relatable to their college demographic. But, like most entertainment products: novelty wears off, interest wanes, and attention moves on.</p><p name=\"5d4e\" id=\"5d4e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Almost a year ago, <a href=\"https://medium.com/secret-den/sunset-bc18450478d5\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/secret-den/sunset-bc18450478d5\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">I decided to shut down a product called Secret.</a> Similar to Yik Yak, it exploded in popularity. Secret had lots of users and lots of money was invested in it. But, we saw the same pattern over and over again: a community would discover the product, it would spread like wildfire, and then die off, almost as quickly as it came.</p><p name=\"e854\" id=\"e854\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The cycle is analogous to video game release cycles. When a quality game releases it sees a spike in usage and attention but is then shelved as players move on to the next thing. Such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_%28video_game%29\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Portal</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_%28video_game%29\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_(video_game)\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Braid</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon Age</a>. However, some games break this cycle and go on to become highly valuable and lasting franchises; games like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Counter-Strike</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Minecraft</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">League of Legends</a>. So what is it that sets these games apart? <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Community.</strong></p><blockquote name=\"1d9e\" id=\"1d9e\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\">For an entertainment product to survive a hype cycle it has to provide unique utility, evolve with its customers, and foster communities.</blockquote><p name=\"9520\" id=\"9520\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Like Secret, Yik Yak captured the imagination of millions of people and provided a lot of entertainment value, but it doesn\u2019t foster community the way social products <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">that</em> <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">last</em> do. I like to refer to this as the <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Fantasy Land Theory</strong>, because most anonymous apps are rooted in just that: fantasy. And like most entertainment, they\u2019re designed to provide an escape from reality.</p><p name=\"4eaf\" id=\"4eaf\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This presents a quandary. While anonymous apps provide an escape, it seems that comes with an inherent expiration date. A quick look at the charts below show how these apps tend to rise in popularity, and then quickly fall, often multiple times.</p></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn\"><figure name=\"77d8\" id=\"77d8\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*lpv-51aAWSBv32MZMh9eWA.png\" data-width=\"4298\" data-height=\"3318\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*lpv-51aAWSBv32MZMh9eWA.png\"></figure></div><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"d83a\" id=\"d83a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blindspot-chat-anonymously/id1063041569?mt=8\" data-href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blindspot-chat-anonymously/id1063041569?mt=8\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blindspot</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brighten/id1033036318?mt=8\" data-href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brighten/id1033036318?mt=8\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Brighten</a> have both raised significant capital and are newcomers to the space, but already showing signs of spiking. Yik Yak and After School have significant spikes which tend to coincide with the start of the school semester, then slowly fall off. Both spike cycles seem to be weakening.</p><h4 name=\"77bd\" id=\"77bd\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Identity matters</h4><p name=\"ebff\" id=\"ebff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Without some form of identity, it\u2019s impossible to form and strengthen lasting relationships with others. Users invest in their online personas by forming new relationships (becoming Facebook friends), providing feedback to others (liking a friend\u2019s Instagram photo) and by sharing our daily lives (posting a story photo in Snapchat). Identity allows for continuity, anonymity doesn\u2019t, and continuity is necessary to strengthen relationships.</p><p name=\"264d\" id=\"264d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Yik Yak has realized this, as it adds features like shared feeds, usernames, and reportedly will be adding chat. For example, the likely thinking is that if users could chat with each other, then they could more easily form real relationships offline, thus providing more utility. We\u2019ll see, but I don\u2019t think that will be enough, unfortunately.</p><p name=\"ed86\" id=\"ed86\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Meanwhile, in the other corner of social app world, Snapchat has demonstrated just how sticky it is.</p><figure name=\"0814\" id=\"0814\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*vIXV_USOoR-ACDppVPz9JQ.png\" data-width=\"2092\" data-height=\"1044\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vIXV_USOoR-ACDppVPz9JQ.png\"></figure><p name=\"736a\" id=\"736a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Snapchat started as the the fastest way to send disappearing photos, providing a novel utility. It then launched Live Stories, evolving and building on its own success. It launched curated, shared stories \u201cOur Story,\u201d fostering communities around the world. And its ascent continues. (Aside: if you look through the lens of \u201cOur Story\u201d posts, Snapchat is a successful anonymous product as curated posts don\u2019t have any identity associated with them.)</p><p name=\"77ce\" id=\"77ce\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">An anonymous app can offer a lot of entertainment and a great escape from reality, but as long as it doesn\u2019t serve an actual useful purpose in our daily lives and tie back into reality, it won\u2019t stand the test of time. I don\u2019t know how to solve the fantasy land problem, because if I did, Secret would probably still exist today.</p></div></div></section><section name=\"1f77\" class=\"section section--body section--last\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"85d0\" id=\"85d0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">Thanks for reading.</p><p name=\"2093\" id=\"2093\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Follow me on Twitter here: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/davidbyttow\" data-href=\"http://twitter.com/davidbyttow\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@davidbyttow</a></p><p name=\"19c5\" id=\"19c5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Follow my next project here: <a href=\"http://twitter.com/bold\" data-href=\"http://twitter.com/bold\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@bold</a></p></div></div></section>\n</section>\n<footer><p>By <a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow\" class=\"p-author h-card\">David Byttow</a> on <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/2795ef0c1855\"><time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2016-04-11T18:32:40.004Z\">April 11, 2016</time></a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/the-inherent-problem-with-anonymous-apps-2795ef0c1855\" class=\"p-canonical\">Canonical link</a></p><p>Exported from <a href=\"https://medium.com\">Medium</a> on January 2, 2021.</p></footer></article></body></html>",

And to understand them, you need data. To that end, developers strive to collect a mountain of data and then mine it to extract meaning and derive hypotheses about their customers.</p><p name=\"1995\" id=\"1995\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While evaluating analytics tools for <a href=\"https://bold.io\" data-href=\"https://bold.io\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bold</a>, a communication platform for companies, I tested some of the latest and greatest analytics services available. A few of them stuck out to me as incredibly powerful, perhaps a little too much so. The three services I tested were <a href=\"http://fullstory.com\" data-href=\"http://fullstory.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fullstory</a>, <a href=\"http://inspectlet.com\" data-href=\"http://inspectlet.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">inspeclet</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.hotjar.com\" data-href=\"http://www.hotjar.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hotjar</a>; all with the goal of providing real-time recordings of user activity with DVR-like capabilities.</p><p name=\"1a57\" id=\"1a57\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, Fullstory\u2019s home page says:</p><blockquote name=\"af5a\" id=\"af5a\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">See what your users see. </strong>Fullstory lets your company easily record, replay, search, and analyze each user\u2019s actual experience with your website. Think of it as your team\u2019s super-searchable DVR for all customer interactions.</blockquote><p name=\"ee0f\" id=\"ee0f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">And here\u2019s a screenshot from inspectlet:</p><figure name=\"73d2\" id=\"73d2\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*3-UVazES-AMMsJtbOmC4lw.png\" data-width=\"963\" data-height=\"342\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3-UVazES-AMMsJtbOmC4lw.png\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Hmm\u2026</figcaption></figure><p name=\"408c\" id=\"408c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">In other words, developers can watch your every mouse twitch and keypress right on their screen; without you ever knowing. From the developer\u2019s perspective (myself included), this is the holy grail of raw user behavior analytics. But from the customer\u2019s vantage point, this can feel a little creepy. Both sides are important to consider.</p><p name=\"e911\" id=\"e911\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">(Feel free to jump to the bottom where I offer a small form of respite in the form of a <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snoopie/ickbbjgidjpmiggaclheacnffnpghpbn\" data-href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snoopie/ickbbjgidjpmiggaclheacnffnpghpbn\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome extension named Snoopie</a>).</p><h4 name=\"9663\" id=\"9663\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">How easy is it for a developer to setup one of\u00a0these?</h4><p name=\"287d\" id=\"287d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Very. For example, with only a few lines of copy/paste Javascript, Fullstory and inspectlet will record every activity your user takes and allow you to play it back. The technology, albeit straightforward, is quite robust. It works by capturing the what the browser is rendering (DOM) and mouse events over time and uploads snapshots up to their servers. The web view is then reconstructed and made available for playback (just like a DVR). <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Note: this clever trick is not possible on native Android and iOS apps.</em></p><p name=\"3c8a\" id=\"3c8a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To be crystal clear, I\u2019m not calling out Fullstory, inspectlet or any others as evil by any means, they all provide great technology and are incredibly useful. But, I\u2019m using these as a specific example as they were the ones we took for a test drive. Upon using the software, all of our engineers had the same sentiment, \u201cthis is kinda creepy\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t feel right watching this.\u201d That was their gut instinct (which is what ultimately lead me to writing this).</p><p name=\"43cd\" id=\"43cd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You might say it\u2019s analogous to a security camera in a retail store or airport, so what\u2019s the big deal? Perhaps, but those are for security purposes and we can usually see the cameras or the signs (that we all tend to ignore).</p><figure name=\"0bcb\" id=\"0bcb\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*HjKQqgsGm5YiidlsE4aVHw.png\" data-width=\"208\" data-height=\"151\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HjKQqgsGm5YiidlsE4aVHw.png\"></figure><p name=\"3abd\" id=\"3abd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">On the web, however, that just doesn\u2019t exist. And there are a couple more more problems to point out:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"9136\" id=\"9136\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">The developer might also know a lot more about you (all of the other information you\u2019ve given them) if you\u2019re logged in or providing any private user data.</li><li name=\"d1e7\" id=\"d1e7\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Virtual everything is recorded by default.</li></ol><p name=\"40f8\" id=\"40f8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">In general this sort of tracking isn\u2019t rooted in malicious intent on the developer\u2019s part, but the opportunity remains to do real damage (purposefully or not). For example, imagine typing your password into the wrong field. Fullstory sees this and plays it back for developers, password in plain sight.</p><p name=\"c4d3\" id=\"c4d3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here\u2019s a a screenshot of onboarding captured with Fullstory (Sadly, animated GIFs aren\u2019t uploading properly on Medium right now)</p><figure name=\"8af0\" id=\"8af0\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*oxeb9YnFFhybSOWDmcqbmQ.png\" data-width=\"848\" data-height=\"692\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oxeb9YnFFhybSOWDmcqbmQ.png\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Mouse movements, what I clicked, what I typed, and other data automatically scooped up, such as my (rough) location.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"99e3\" id=\"99e3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">To be fair, Fullstory and others offer some ability to \u201cexclude\u201d elements from being recorded, but this takes work (typically by specifying <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors\" data-href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CSS class selectors</a>) and is easily overlooked until someone realizes they shouldn\u2019t be collecting it. In Fullstory\u2019s case, the only default exclusion is for password input fields (which are censored in browsers by default, but can still reveal the length of a password).</p><h4 name=\"6197\" id=\"6197\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">What should developers do?</h4><p name=\"0812\" id=\"0812\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">To reiterate, I believe these types of tools are extremely useful in the right hands. As developers, I believe that customers should be made aware that they are being recorded if they\u2019re logged in or providing private data. It\u2019s one thing to record anonymous user sessions on your marketing pages to detect inefficiencies and optimize click-through rates, but an entirely other to track everything going on in your service.</p><p name=\"95da\" id=\"95da\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, a service might provide a disclaimer upfront (we all know that nobody reads the ToS) or anonymize user data whenever possible.</p><p name=\"3a5d\" id=\"3a5d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Most importantly though, you must consider what\u2019s worth tracking and what\u2019s not, based on the type of software you\u2019re providing. For example, go ahead and record how anonymous users respond to the redesign of your new home page, but not how easy it is to fill out your shiny new credit card form.</p><p name=\"e31c\" id=\"e31c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Still not convinced because you want this treasure trove of data?<br></strong>Consider the fact that these services often use their own service. To put it another way: Fullstory uses Fullstory itself to record you on Fullstory. So they could watch you watch your users on your service\u200a\u2014\u200amind blown.</p><h4 name=\"9eb5\" id=\"9eb5\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">What should the rest of us\u00a0do?</h4><p name=\"7918\" id=\"7918\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">As a customer, unfortunately, there\u2019s not much we can do short of inspecting the loaded Javascript (too hard on desktop and forget about doing it on your mobile browser).</p><p name=\"8213\" id=\"8213\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So, as a Sunday afternoon project, I built a <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snoopie/ickbbjgidjpmiggaclheacnffnpghpbn\" data-href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snoopie/ickbbjgidjpmiggaclheacnffnpghpbn\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">simple Chrome extension named Snoopie</a>, that will monitor the sites you visit and let you know when it detects one of the popular tracking services.

We take privacy and security very seriously and feel it\u2019s important to be direct, open and honest about how our system works in order to build trust with you, our community.</p><h3 name=\"f4b6\" id=\"f4b6\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Taking a look under the\u00a0hood</h3><p name=\"ab50\" id=\"ab50\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Let\u2019s focus on two components. Storage\u200a\u2014\u200ahow and where we store your data. Delivery\u200a\u2014\u200ahow we deliver secrets to people you know.</p><h4 name=\"7709\" id=\"7709\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Storage</strong></h4><p name=\"7acc\" id=\"7acc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Secret data is stored on Google servers that are located in the same data centers as Gmail. This means <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">your secrets benefit from Google\u2019s physical security and are essentially as safe from physical misuse as your Gmail. </strong>Having been a Google engineer with intimate knowledge of the backend services, I made this choice so that Secret users would benefit from Google\u2019s robust physical security.</p><p name=\"ffc2\" id=\"ffc2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A few high-level details:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"e8ab\" id=\"e8ab\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Secret is hosted on <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/appengine\" data-href=\"https://developers.google.com/appengine\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google App Engine</a>. It\u2019s written almost entirely in Go, but has various components in Java and Python.</li><li name=\"8b76\" id=\"8b76\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">All transmission sent over the wire is encrypted with TLS.</li><li name=\"3d9e\" id=\"3d9e\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">We use a highly-available, non-relational datastore built on top of Google\u2019s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigTable\" data-href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigTable\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BigTable</a>. There is no relational datastore.</li><li name=\"6b40\" id=\"6b40\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">All message data is encrypted before being written to the datastore. Keys are stored in an off-site keystore service that rotates keys.</li><li name=\"32d3\" id=\"32d3\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Images are stored in <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/cloud-storage/\" data-href=\"https://cloud.google.com/products/cloud-storage/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google\u2019s Cloud Storage</a> datastore and served over TLS from Google\u2019s image frontend service.</li></ul><p name=\"9ce0\" id=\"9ce0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Contacts. </strong>When we connect you with people you know from your Contacts, we don\u2019t send raw phone numbers or email addresses to our servers. Instead, we locally <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function\" data-href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hash</a> the contact details first (with shared salt), which the server then uses to compare against other hashed values. For example, [+15552786005] might become[a22d75c92a630725f4] and the original phone number never leaves your phone. This is a one-way transformation. In other words, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">we don\u2019t know the phone number or email address that corresponds to the hash value.</strong></p><p name=\"79f6\" id=\"79f6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Important note: Although we salt the data, it is possible to match a phone number to a hash, especially if the salt is known to an attacker. We\u2019re looking at ways to make this even more secure (e.g., by joining client-specific data pre-hash or Diffie-Hellman key exchange). If you have a suggestion, please let us know at security@secret.ly as this is an active area of research for us.</p><p name=\"af6e\" id=\"af6e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Secrets. </strong>Secret metadata are stored without referencing users. Instead, when delivering a secret to a user, we create a unique token for that user and grant it access to the secret, as a many-to-one relationship. The token resource resides in an ACL owned by the secret, not the user. Message data (comments and posts) are encrypted on the server and decrypted when the unique token is exchanged for the secret. As a result, personally identifiable data does not need to presented alongside secrets.</p><p name=\"15a9\" id=\"15a9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">These data structures (users, posts and ACLs) are logically separated in our datastore. While this abstraction provides no physical security, it does prevent a simple observer from identifying secret authors and affords us the ability to easily decouple the data in the future.</p><p name=\"c047\" id=\"c047\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Identity. </strong>Moderators are not able to access or modify posts created by a specific user. In the event that we need to access or modify information for administrative, debugging or other purposes, we employ a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-man_rule\" data-href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-man_rule\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">two-man rule</a>. Essentially, two people with access must turn their keys at the same time. That is, two admins (currently the two founders) must both be logged in with their Google accounts (which are protected by two-factor authentication) and request the same resource in a given time frame. For further reading, a similar system is described <a href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/red-october-cloudflares-open-source-implementation-of-the-two-man-rule\" data-href=\"http://blog.cloudflare.com/red-october-cloudflares-open-source-implementation-of-the-two-man-rule\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in this blogpost</a> by Cloudflare, known as Red October.</p><h4 name=\"ba54\" id=\"ba54\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">Delivery</strong></h4><p name=\"5d8b\" id=\"5d8b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Secret\u2019s delivery system was designed to meet the following requirements:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"0aa7\" id=\"0aa7\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">It should be secure.</li><li name=\"511a\" id=\"511a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">It should be fast.</li><li name=\"fa07\" id=\"fa07\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">It should learn.</li></ul><p name=\"4e40\" id=\"4e40\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">What happens when you post</strong></p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"6c83\" id=\"6c83\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">The post is first stored and delivered to the author.</li><li name=\"448a\" id=\"448a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">An asynchronous job runs and determines who the secret should be delivered to, which are people that we believe are connected to you, or you otherwise might find relevant. Contacts are simply a strong signal in the algorithm.</li><li name=\"0768\" id=\"0768\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Each delivery is unique per-user, and can be rebersed.

For example, the fewer \u201cfriends\u201d a user has on the system, the less we show them. This helps to avoid simple tricks to isolate individuals and their secrets.</p><p name=\"5ed8\" id=\"5ed8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As a user with few or no friends, many secrets from people you may know are not visible. Once you have enough friends, we show you a little more, such as the fact that a particular secret comes from within \u201cYour circle,\u201d which is defined as \u201cFriend\u201d or \u201cFriend of friend.\u201d Then, after quite a few more, we show you whether or not a particular post came from a friend or not.

I ran around Munster, Indiana like a lunatic and started my own lawn-mowing business for the (mostly elderly) folks that lived within a 1/2 mile radius. I was very active.</p><p name=\"1ae5\" id=\"1ae5\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But everything changed when I got a job at 19 programming video games. I felt I had something to prove. I did nothing except sit in front of the computer screen. I didn\u2019t drink alcohol until I was about 23, but I ate terribly. I\u2019d go through 3-4 Coke\u2019s or Mountain Dew\u2019s in a day and eat a full breakfast, lunch and dinner with plenty of snacks in between; usually at my computer.</p><p name=\"93cb\" id=\"93cb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By the time I was 25 years old, I had a lot of success in my career. I was a lead programmer at Double Helix. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">But I weighed 250 lbs.</strong> That\u2019s 113 kilograms. My jean size was 44 inches. Note, I am 5&#39;11&quot;tall.</p><p name=\"882a\" id=\"882a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">(Oh dear god, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to post this..)</p><figure name=\"d8a6\" id=\"d8a6\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*N4iL4OV_fNsp_MFP.jpeg\" data-width=\"307\" data-height=\"400\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*N4iL4OV_fNsp_MFP.jpeg\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">At my first video game job.

I dwarfed him, not in height because he\u2019s sadly an inch taller than me, but in width. I was shocked. I had to lose the weight.</p><p name=\"176c\" id=\"176c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My trick was all about <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">creating rewards. </strong>I would turn everything I wanted to do into a reward for exercising. For example, almost every single night I would watch two reruns of Seinfeld. But it was only allowed if I went running first. The only thing that couldn\u2019t be a reward was food.</p><figure name=\"82e4\" id=\"82e4\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutInsetLeft graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*Sc7-Q9YRA9y_Ze4m.jpeg\" data-width=\"423\" data-height=\"326\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*Sc7-Q9YRA9y_Ze4m.jpeg\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">About 215\u00a0lbs.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"016e\" id=\"016e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I literally wore t-shirts and gym shorts every single day, including to work. This way, I could jog or do exercise at a moment\u2019s notice comfortably.</p><p name=\"5a12\" id=\"5a12\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Three months later, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">I was 195 lbs.</strong> That\u2019s 55 pounds lost in three months. Or 0.6 lbs per day. Or <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">negative 2100</em> calories per day. Most physicians will say that\u2019s not possible without starving. Well, that\u2019s basically true. I would usually start the day off with a yogurt or banana, have 8-10 slices of turkey and some vegetables for lunch, and finish the evening with a yogurt and some Fiber One cereal sprinkled over it. I also ran every evening for about 30-45 minutes. By \u201cran\u201d I really mean that I walked with the occasional burst of jogging. Eventually, that turned into full on running.</p><p name=\"24e6\" id=\"24e6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To summarize the three months:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"bd21\" id=\"bd21\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Severe deficit of calories. Generally 600-800 intake per day. No alcohol.</li><li name=\"5218\" id=\"5218\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Cardio every day. At least ~30 minutes burst jogging.</li><li name=\"f2be\" id=\"f2be\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Random bits of exercise throughout the day whenever possible. 7 pairs of gym shorts and t-shirts recommended.</li></ol><h3 name=\"c1f0\" id=\"c1f0\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--li\">Phase 2 - Obsession</h3><p name=\"6ee3\" id=\"6ee3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">This weight got me through the next year comfortably. I was still cautious about what I ate, and slowly declined down to about 190 lbs. But then I picked up a copy of <a href=\"http://www.absdiet.com/uof/absdiet/abospl/\" data-href=\"http://www.absdiet.com/uof/absdiet/abospl/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Abs Diet</a>, and everything changed again. My friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/verytragic\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/verytragic\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Cureton</a> and I made a pact. I was to get down to 165 lbs, and he would get down to 190. As fast as humanly possible. In three months.</p><p name=\"cb20\" id=\"cb20\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I ran almost every morning, we went to the gym almost every night and we pre-planned our exercises. I remember one night I went to the gym at midnight and returned at 5AM. In hindsight, I might have been a little obsessed. We kept each other honest. We were inspired by the likes of Ronnie Coleman. I read Arnold\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Encyclopedia-Modern-Bodybuilding/dp/0684857219\" data-href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Encyclopedia-Modern-Bodybuilding/dp/0684857219\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">book</a>, which I referred to as \u201cThe Bible,\u201d twice cover-to-cover.</p><figure name=\"a8c2\" id=\"a8c2\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutInsetLeft graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*6o1TGquzWPMJpF7S.jpeg\" data-width=\"298\" data-height=\"300\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*6o1TGquzWPMJpF7S.jpeg\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">170 lbs. Please pardon the ridiculousness of this\u00a0photo.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"4133\" id=\"4133\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I didn\u2019t stay in the gym for more than 55 minutes, 15 of which were spent on cardio and the remaining 40 weight training. Mostly everything revolved around the bench press, squats and dead lifts.</p><p name=\"044e\" id=\"044e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This time, instead of starving myself, I took a very balanced approach. Low-carb and I ate five portioned meals per day. For my snacks, I ate Myoplex bars. I remember sitting them next to me at my keyboard and I would count the minutes until I could eat it.</p><p name=\"0ff9\" id=\"0ff9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I took the same reward approach. Except this time, my reward was generally <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">healthy</em> food. There was nothing better than steak and broccoli after a workout. I would literally go out to eat with friends and get more vegetables for \u201cdesert\u201d.</p><p name=\"bc6f\" id=\"bc6f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Three months later, I discovered I could comfortably wear size small t-shirts from Express and American Apparel and my jean size was 30 inches. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">I weighed 155 lbs.</strong></p><figure name=\"ec2b\" id=\"ec2b\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*Q0LuuSM4oJTq24LQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"335\" data-height=\"400\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Q0LuuSM4oJTq24LQ.jpeg\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">155 lbs. And a\u00a0cat.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"c73c\" id=\"c73c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">To summarize:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"2615\" id=\"2615\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Planned weight-lifting 45 minutes per day, 5 days per week.</li><li name=\"1713\" id=\"1713\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Cardio 30-45 minutes per day, 5 days per week.</li><li name=\"f7ed\" id=\"f7ed\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Balanced, low-carb diet, 5 meals per day. About 1800-2000 calories daily.</li><li name=\"329a\" id=\"329a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">A partner to keep you honest at the gym.</li></ol><h3 name=\"2c6d\" id=\"2c6d\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--li\">Phase 3 - Maintenance</h3><p name=\"5159\" id=\"5159\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">This is probably the hardest phase of them all. Especially while working at places like Google that offer free food. But I managed to hover between 155-165 for about four years.</p><p name=\"8791\" id=\"8791\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Today I weigh around 180 lbs. But I don\u2019t look like I did when I was coming down from 255 because of the muscle gained from Phase 2. Nevertheless, as my father would say: <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">\u201cTime to hit it and get it!\u201d</em> Indeed.</p><p name=\"b76a\" id=\"b76a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">My personal ideal weight and new target is 170.

As a system scales and evolves, the number of possible failure modes and scenarios grow proportionally.</p><p name=\"f1ec\" id=\"f1ec\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There are many lessons that I have learned over the years of navigating the torrent waters of large-scale, service-oriented architectures. Much of the advice I offer and decisions I make on a daily basis are gut instincts based on such experiences. But the reasons are often not obvious, and can often seem counter-intuitive or limiting.</p><p name=\"4b3e\" id=\"4b3e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">First, read Jeff Hodges\u2019 article on distributed programming: <a href=\"http://bryanpendleton.blogspot.mx/2013/01/jeff-hodges-on-distributed-systems.html\" data-href=\"http://bryanpendleton.blogspot.mx/2013/01/jeff-hodges-on-distributed-systems.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">http://bryanpendleton.blogspot.mx/2013/01/jeff-hodges-on-distributed-systems.html</a></p><p name=\"f231\" id=\"f231\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Any advice below assumes a distributed system that:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"89a1\" id=\"89a1\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\">Is service-oriented</li><li name=\"128e\" id=\"128e\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Is spread across multiple regions</li><li name=\"902e\" id=\"902e\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Strives for 99.9%+ reliability</li><li name=\"689a\" id=\"689a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Hosts user data</li><li name=\"808d\" id=\"808d\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Has at least linear organic growth</li></ul><p name=\"ab96\" id=\"ab96\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Design for partial failure everywhere.</strong> In the world of computing, anything can and everything will fail at least once. If your iPhone has given you zero problems and your Mac has been solid since the day you opened it, then consider yourself lucky. Yet, there\u2019s a very good reason the Genius Bar is almost always packed, those devices fail all the time. And your commodity hardware will too.</p><p name=\"2a78\" id=\"2a78\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Servers, load-balancers, firewalls, NICs, disks, memory, racks, cabling, power that run your applications, you name it, are not infallible.</p><p name=\"9cd1\" id=\"9cd1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Make everything idempotent. </strong>Idempotence is essentially a mathematical property that means applying the same operation multiple times will not change the result. When making a request, it\u2019s often the case that the caller does not know if a failed request simply was lost but still succeeded (perhaps partially) or failed altogether. Without idempotence, retrying would be impossible. Imagine the case where a machine in a cluster completely fails while processing a request, the client would be left with a disconnect yet still want a result, so it retries to another machine.</p><p name=\"47f0\" id=\"47f0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Maintain a Test Universe. </strong>This is critical. You want a silo\u2019d universe that completely mimicks your production world. Developers must be able to work in a sandbox that does not touch production-critical data all while having the confidence that their code will work in production. Developing against production data is a great way to corrupt or lose user data, which is the worst possible thing you could do. Do this early, and make sure that every feature, service and application you build works in the developer sandbox, and ideally, on the same hardware that runs your application in production. That way, an application that is deployed into test can then be promoted to production much more easily and safely.</p><p name=\"32b7\" id=\"32b7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Capacity planning is hard. Do it anyway. </strong>And err on the side of gross overestimation. Ideally, we would all build for 10x and design for 100x. This effectively means, you\u2019ve load-tested your system to 10x its expected peak capacity and you know that it can scale horizontally to 100x by simply adding more physical hardware.</p><p name=\"a156\" id=\"a156\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At Square, this was very important when we built out the infrastructure for supporting all of Starbucks card-processing. We tested our primary datacenters up to 10x</p><p name=\"e921\" id=\"e921\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">If it can be stateless, it should be.</strong> This typically applies to frontends or middle-tier layer services. State here refers to storing some data in a data storage layer. Jeff Hodges\u2019 mentions this too Frontends can apply to either services that render web pages or serve data requests. You always want to minimize the number of places that store state, because when it scales it will be much harder to maintain consistency of state across those instances.</p><p name=\"4b20\" id=\"4b20\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Imagine you\u2019re happily running instances of PostgreSQL on the West Coast, but are scaling into Europe and need trans-Atlantic redundancy so your users don\u2019t need to suffer 200+ ms to scale to East Coast\u2026 Nope. Think again. Synchronous replication is just as slow. Asynchronous replication will work, but introduces eventual consistency. There are solutions, but no silver bullets. Reducing where state is stored is the easiest way to manage this complexity so you don\u2019t need to solve it too many times.</p><p name=\"48e4\" id=\"48e4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Reconsider that expensive flash storage.</strong> Expensive and powerful flash storage (such as Fusion-io) can be amazingly addictive. It\u2019s a silver bullet for not-easily-partitionable data storage services. But, there\u2019s a ceiling, and approaching it can turn into a crisis for your organization. This is essentially \u201cvertical scaling.\u201d If your application is successful, you will approach the ceiling and be left with \u201ccode red\u201d projects to find clever ways to increase your runway all while re-architecting critical systems to horizontally scale.</p><p name=\"171b\" id=\"171b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Deploy early and often. </strong>Don\u2019t wait a week for a deploy. In active development environments, a single application may not change, but the frameworks and code around it sure will. A service owner cannot know when their service may stop working as a result of an indirect change outside of their application. Deploying often is the only way to combat adverse side effects, because each deploy reduces the problem space for debugging any new problem.</p><p name=\"c3ce\" id=\"c3ce\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Don\u2019t copy user data.</strong> At least not user data that you intend to be served back. By \u201cuser data\u201d i mean \u201cdata created on behalf of the user taking some action,\u201d such as filling out a form or paying for a cup of coffee. A good rule of thumb is to think about how easy it is for the user to completely delete their data, should they choose to, accurately and comprehensively. When you copy it around, this becomes very difficult. Imagine that they own this data, so it\u2019s important to treat it with the respect it deserves. It\u2019s best to keep a canonical source for serving, all other sources can and should be treated as semantical caches or replicas for analysis or non-visible purposes.</p><p name=\"36b4\" id=\"36b4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Above is just a few lessons I\u2019ve learned over the years.</p></div></div></section>\n</section>\n<footer><p>By <a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow\" class=\"p-author h-card\">David Byttow</a> on <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/9140c358976c\"><time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2013-05-04T00:44:52.146Z\">May 4, 2013</time></a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/distributed-programming-is-hard-9140c358976c\" class=\"p-canonical\">Canonical link</a></p><p>Exported from <a href=\"https://medium.com\">Medium</a> on January 2, 2021.</p></footer></article></body></html>",

In that short time, we\u2019ve grown our team to 25 incredible people and signed up over 15 million people around the world.</p><p name=\"6dab\" id=\"6dab\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It\u2019s been an amazing journey. And with every journey, we expect some change. With that, I\u2019d like to pass along a note from Chrys:</p><blockquote name=\"f9fe\" id=\"f9fe\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">With Secret, David and I set out to create a new platform that allows people to be their most authentic selves. I think we did exactly that, enabling us to assemble an incredible team along the way. It\u2019s become clear that the next chapter of Secret is beginning in a way that will be less about the kind of creation and design that I love, and so it\u2019s time for me to step down, let the team do what they do best, and focus on what I do best. Secret\u2019s design is in good hands with Ben Lee (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SirBenLee\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/SirBenLee\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@SirBenLee</a>), the best designer I\u2019ve worked with, and I\u2019m excited to see what he comes up with next.\u200a\u2014\u200aChrys</blockquote><p name=\"43bd\" id=\"43bd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">I\u2019m so proud of what we\u2019ve built in such a short time, and it couldn\u2019t have been done without Chrys. I knew when we met at Google that we would find a way to work on something together, and I am both proud of and thankful for what we built\u200a\u2014\u200aI can\u2019t wait to see what he does next.</p><p name=\"3546\" id=\"3546\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As for Secret, we have big plans. As you know, we went through a major overhaul just a month ago. And while change is hard, I\u2019m happy to say that it\u2019s been a success on nearly every level.</p><p name=\"0dfe\" id=\"0dfe\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Our mission is to create a more open and curious world. Secret is the \u201csecond screen\u201d to life that allows us discover what\u2019s going on around us, understand new perspectives and share what\u2019s really on our mind.</p><p name=\"7380\" id=\"7380\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">David</p></div></div></section>\n</section>\n<footer><p>By <a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow\" class=\"p-author h-card\">David Byttow</a> on <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/16d7c7b23629\"><time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2015-01-30T02:03:57.536Z\">January 30, 2015</time></a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/new-beginnings-16d7c7b23629\" class=\"p-canonical\">Canonical link</a></p><p>Exported from <a href=\"https://medium.com\">Medium</a> on January 2, 2021.</p></footer></article></body></html>",

But these events are few and far between, and requiring a separate app does the concept a disservice. What if you find yourself in front of a burning building, but haven\u2019t download Periscope? People should think Twitter and Twitter alone.</p><p name=\"6bbc\" id=\"6bbc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Meanwhile, it\u2019s great that Twitter made Periscope available directly in the timeline itself, but they should make \u201cgo live\u201d an option in its app, as simple as clicking a button. It then does everything in its power to make that available, such as to your followers, those in your geographical location, etc.</p><p name=\"da75\" id=\"da75\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For what it\u2019s worth, Periscope has been on a downward trend this year (according to App Annie ranks), and I think it\u2019s because the average person doesn\u2019t find value in the app itself. It\u2019s time to reign it in and make video great again.</p><p name=\"7b35\" id=\"7b35\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">Disclaimer: I say this with all of the love in my heart because I have dear friends that work on Periscope. They are amazing and deserve to have their work mean the most it can. I hope I\u2019m wrong and whatever Twitter\u2019s strategy is here, is the right one.</em></strong></p><h3 name=\"18a8\" id=\"18a8\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">4. Redefine what \u201cLive\u201d means on\u00a0Twitter</h3><p name=\"eded\" id=\"eded\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Bear with me because this is one is a bit more abstract.</p><p name=\"dc7d\" id=\"dc7d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">According to Jack, Twitter is \u201clive.\u201d But the inherent problem with live content is that it\u2019s synchronous, and we live in an ever-increasingly asynchronous world. Synchronous content works when it\u2019s newsworthy, highly relevant to an individual, or extremely compelling. This is why networks like HBO and Netflix spend billions on premium content. It costs big $$$ to manufacture undivided attention of a massive audience for an extended period.</p><p name=\"a75c\" id=\"a75c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One of Twitter\u2019s core strengths is that you can jump in and get \u201ccaught up\u201d any time on the most recent happenings in the world. And that brings me to my hypothesis:</p><blockquote name=\"6883\" id=\"6883\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Twitter has the capability to <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\">redefine live</strong>,<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\"> </strong>where live means being<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong\"> </strong>\u201cin the moment,\u201d even if its actually in the past.</blockquote><p name=\"c713\" id=\"c713\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">So what does that even mean? Well, I missed yesterday\u2019s Warrior\u2019s game one, where they lost handily to the Spurs. Why can\u2019t I relive that through many different vantage points directly in Twitter? Twitter has the data; it\u2019s just not grouped and surfaced in that way.</p><p name=\"31fa\" id=\"31fa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Text is the most widely used and one of the oldest mediums on the planet. It\u2019s not going anywhere any time soon, and its Twitter\u2019s primary medium. Therefore, it has a unique opportunity to capture all of this commentary and discussion and serve it for years and years to come. Imagine if when you were reading a book about the Civil War or the Holocaust in history, you could go back and see all of the commentary, photos, videos (from both sides) that lead up to these events. You could completely immerse yourself and relive the experience. Twitter can (and should) make this available a hundred years from now for the 2016 Presidential Race, regardless of the outcome on November 8th.</p><p name=\"1b69\" id=\"1b69\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In short, I believe the company should focus less on striking all of these live deals that are already available on primetime television (NFL, Presidential Debates, etc) that are not really expanding their base, and instead focus on a unique offering that only Twitter can provide: the ability to immerse myself in an event, regardless if its happening now or not.</p><h3 name=\"7226\" id=\"7226\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">5. Double down on\u00a0Moments</h3><p name=\"bc8c\" id=\"bc8c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Moments is effectively the \u201ctabloid\u201d version of Twitter, which is perfect for new and casual users. It\u2019s a killer app built on top of the tweet firehose. However, it\u2019s buried in the app and feels \u201cbolted on.\u201d Furthermore, it\u2019s hardly evolved since its launch, short of the ability to create moments with the web version of the product, which is a fine first step\u200a\u2014\u200abut you need to move faster because Moments could be Twitter\u2019s version of Google Reader (which was awesome).</p><p name=\"e708\" id=\"e708\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As an avid Twitter user, I love moments. I go there every day to get a birds-eye view (no pun) of what\u2019s happening in the world right now. It spans the emotional gamut, with everything from comedy to tragedy. It also gives users another reason to participate in the global conversations, have their tweets featured and be \u201cdiscovered.\u201d</p><p name=\"4d93\" id=\"4d93\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Sadly, many people don\u2019t even know it exists. I showed and explained Moments to some friends that are self-proclaimed \u201cTwitter lurkers,\u201d but had no clue what Moments was. They were instantly hooked some drew a comparison to \u201cDiscover\u201d in Snapchat or a visual RSS aggregator.</p><p name=\"75c0\" id=\"75c0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">PS. Moments is a perfect location to surface live events as they\u2019re happening. When the first NFL game was aired on Twitter, it was naturally the first place I went to find it, but didn\u2019t.</p><h3 name=\"ea04\" id=\"ea04\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">6. Crack the social search\u00a0problem</h3><p name=\"bcef\" id=\"bcef\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Twitter search has so much potential to be more than it is today. Everyone knows how to use search thanks to Google, who figured out how to magically search the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">entire open web</em> over 15 years ago. Why shouldn\u2019t Twitter aim to do the same for its own content? Based on my anecdotal experience, many people believe that Twitter search is only for hashtags. For example, why can\u2019t I search \u201cbest TVs\u201d on Twitter and immediately find relevant and compelling articles that were tweeted about TVs and the discussion around these items? In fact, why can\u2019t I just search \u201cTVs\u201d and get halfway decent results? Try it yourself.</p><p name=\"4a45\" id=\"4a45\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Search is arguably one of the most powerful features for a new user. They will come to Twitter for the first time, and if they don\u2019t immediately see content relevant to them, will try and search for it. If that doesn\u2019t produce at least a somewhat relevant experience, then you\u2019ve lost them.</p><h3 name=\"2bd2\" id=\"2bd2\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">7. Automagically group tweets by\u00a0topic</h3><p name=\"7ea0\" id=\"7ea0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">I often scroll through my feed and see the same topic being discussed by many different people. For example, a large amount of my feed right now is about the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/this-is-the-surface-studio-microsofts-new-all-in-one-pc/\" data-href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/26/this-is-the-surface-studio-microsofts-new-all-in-one-pc/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft\u2019s Surface Studio</a> announcement. But, it\u2019s mixed with election tweets, random tweets from people I follow, and ads. That\u2019s a bad experience. Allow me to \u201cpivot\u201d on any given tweet into a stream of tweets about that same topic, and I don\u2019t mean hashtag search #SurfaceStudio or #Trump. Twitter should do more to \u201cintelligently group\u201d similar tweets in a way that allows me to experience <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">what\u2019s happening about that topic</em>.</p><h3 name=\"8db8\" id=\"8db8\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">8. Other incremental core product enhancements</h3><p name=\"c5ee\" id=\"c5ee\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">I believe the core product is <a href=\"http://startupljackson.com/post/128504446315/twitters-product-is-fucking-fine\" data-href=\"http://startupljackson.com/post/128504446315/twitters-product-is-fucking-fine\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fucking fine</a>, but wanted to add a few incremental improvements that I think might make the overall experience better.</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"d2b6\" id=\"d2b6\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Add read receipts. </strong>Every tweet should tell you who has seen the tweet. This gives further insight into your tweets and how they resonate with your audience. There are many ways to implement this, for example, if you have a tweet on your screen for longer than a second, that counts as a \u201cread.\u201d People need to know who is reading their content, not just liking or clicking through it.</li><li name=\"da16\" id=\"da16\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Improve conversation readability.</strong> It is way too hard to follow a conversation between two people, let alone three or more. Twitter has all of the data it needs to surface a UI that is far more capable of presenting a conversation than is done today. If Reddit can manage N-levels of depth in its conversations, Twitter can do it too.</li><li name=\"8876\" id=\"8876\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Suggest hashtags on compose.</strong> While writing a post on a particular topic, it wouldn\u2019t be too hard for Twitter to offer hashtags relevant to that topic that you can quickly \u201cadd\u201d to your tweet. Medium does this with tags, and it works quite well for them. There\u2019s nothing worse than posting a tweet about a topic and forgetting (or never knowing there was) a hashtag that could have been added to give your tweet more exposure.</li></ul><h4 name=\"950b\" id=\"950b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--li\">And a few words on\u00a0Safety</h4><p name=\"27b4\" id=\"27b4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">I want to recognize that this post does not address Twitter\u2019s bullying/abuse issues. Twitter is an open and free network that anyone can join and the point is such that any person in the world can spread a thought whose impact is directly proportional to the merit and timeliness of the idea.</p><p name=\"40fb\" id=\"40fb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Twitter\u2019s future as a global platform hinges on the ability for real people to have open and honest discourse without an underlying fear of unexpected retribution or retaliation. I don\u2019t know how to solve that completely, and I\u2019m not even sure the technology or enforceable policy exists, but Twitter should continue to work hard at these problems, even if it means making drastic policy changes along the way.</p><h3 name=\"35f1\" id=\"35f1\" class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">In conclusion</h3><p name=\"07a0\" id=\"07a0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">That was a short list of things that I feel are important to Twitter. And there\u2019s no shortage of other ideas that could make the experience incrementally better (not stickers!), but I think the first step is to get out from under scrutiny and do what it does best: <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">create the right constraints.</strong></p><p name=\"9f39\" id=\"9f39\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Twitter needs to reign itself in and focus on its core product, making it an approachable, yet infinitely deep experience. Jack and the leadership team should obsess over the details of the core product and embolden the teams to move as fast and as deliberately as possible.</p></div></div></section><section name=\"cc35\" class=\"section section--body section--last\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"e274\" id=\"e274\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">Feel free to follow me on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/davidbyttow\" data-href=\"http://twitter.com/davidbyttow\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@davidbyttow</a></p><p name=\"16ba\" id=\"16ba\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">You should subscribe to my email newsletter: <a href=\"http://newsletter.davidbyttom\" data-href=\"http://newsletter.davidbyttom\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">newsletter.davidbyttow.com</a></p></div></div></section>\n</section>\n<footer><p>By <a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow\" class=\"p-author h-card\">David Byttow</a> on <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/4b67a83190d3\"><time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2016-10-26T21:49:36.637Z\">October 26, 2016</time></a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/some-ramblings-about-twitter-4b67a83190d3\" class=\"p-canonical\">Canonical link</a></p><p>Exported from <a href=\"https://medium.com\">Medium</a> on January 2, 2021.</p></footer></article></body></html>",

I meant to bring it back on Sunday but was late for a 8:30AM flight. I will be back next week and return it sometime then, probably Monday. Thanks!\u201d</blockquote><p name=\"bc82\" id=\"bc82\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">Then edited it down to:</p><blockquote name=\"0f3e\" id=\"0f3e\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Absolutely. Sorry for the delay. Had to run out of town.</blockquote><p name=\"c57c\" id=\"c57c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote\">The original message is redundant. For starters, the sender is already asking to return the item back next week, there\u2019s no reason for me to repeat it. All I need to basically say is yes, apologize and a brief explanation why I\u2019m late.</p><p name=\"a3b4\" id=\"a3b4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Actually, now that I look at this, the best response would have been:</p><blockquote name=\"a5fe\" id=\"a5fe\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p\">Yes.</blockquote><p name=\"3ab8\" id=\"3ab8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote graf--trailing\">And I should bring it back on Monday.</p></div></div></section>\n</section>\n<footer><p>By <a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow\" class=\"p-author h-card\">David Byttow</a> on <a href=\"https://medium.com/p/36113a1df3e7\"><time class=\"dt-published\" datetime=\"2013-05-05T00:42:18.047Z\">May 5, 2013</time></a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@davidbyttow/be-succinct-36113a1df3e7\" class=\"p-canonical\">Canonical link</a></p><p>Exported from <a href=\"https://medium.com\">Medium</a> on January 2, 2021.</p></footer></article></body></html>",

I call him a builder.</p><p name=\"4f7c\" id=\"4f7c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Everyone builds. Whether it be a model car, an app, or a family. To me, building is the simple act of creating something from nothing.</p><p name=\"92c7\" id=\"92c7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At a very young age, my father built model airplanes and cars. By his early teenage years, began flying radio-controlled aircraft with other hobbyists that were four times his age. Rather than cultivating a social life, he spent most of time in his basement workspace. He was focused, determined and enjoyed every minute of it.</p><p name=\"65ed\" id=\"65ed\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And building wasn\u2019t only a hobby, it became his career. Today, with a little wood and a lot of creativity, he builds works of art that are beautiful, practical, and timeless. They must be both aesthetically pleasing and serve a functional purpose every day for years.</p><figure name=\"0334\" id=\"0334\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutInsetLeft graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*tDsEy4Kw82A-5hN9.jpeg\" data-width=\"352\" data-height=\"266\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*tDsEy4Kw82A-5hN9.jpeg\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Curved kitchen in\u00a0red.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"0ef0\" id=\"0ef0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">His business, Byttow Woodworking, a high-end, custom cabinetry business, has been a labor of love for over 30 years of his life, after taking it over from his father, Norman Byttow. I\u2019ve never known him to do anything else professionally.</p><p name=\"c715\" id=\"c715\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Malcolm Gladwell claims the key to success in any field is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing a specific task for a total of around 10,000 hours. With some quick back of the envelope math, my dad has easily spent well over 100,000 hours honing his craft. That is over 11 years straight spent building. Or, 1/5 of his life, which is a lot considering 1/3 of our lives are spent sleeping.</p><figure name=\"1a0e\" id=\"1a0e\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutInsetLeft graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*PLYo0m99QM5zFsuT.jpeg\" data-width=\"400\" data-height=\"540\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/0*PLYo0m99QM5zFsuT.jpeg\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">In the\u00a0shop.</figcaption></figure><p name=\"4e51\" id=\"4e51\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Spend two minutes with Mark Byttow, and you will know that you have met someone good, honest, and pure in his intentions. He is young at heart, with a child-like innocence that those close to him cannot help but love to be around.</p><p name=\"b492\" id=\"b492\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Although he sometimes refers to himself as \u201cThe Big Arm\u201d or \u201cTower of Power,\u201d he is a gentle giant. Standing 6&#39;3&quot; tall with blond hair, blue eyes, and a very muscular physique; but not because he spends his time at the gym. My dad has a very rare, genetic neuromuscular disease, called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myotonia_congenita\" data-href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myotonia_congenita\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">myotonia congenita</a>.</p><p name=\"e28d\" id=\"e28d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Luckily, he has a variation that makes him capable of living a normal life. The upside is that it has granted him the type of physique that many people spend years cultivating at the gym. The primary downside, however, is that he lacks the ability to activate his fast-twitch muscles without first \u201cwarming them up\u201d. His first few steps are reminiscent of Frankenstein\u2019s stiff-legged walk. But, he quickly settles into a standard gait. Most people never notice, and he does a great job of covering it up, but it prevented him from being involved in sports as a child. Perhaps this has played into his childhood spent building models and toys.</p></div></div></section><section name=\"e362\" class=\"section section--body\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"912d\" id=\"912d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">Needless to say, my father has been one of the biggest inspirations of my life.

In this article, I explain how I keep all of my accounts secure by creating strong, unique AND memorable passwords.</p><p name=\"a11d\" id=\"a11d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Signing in to an account is all about proving your identity. And that can be accomplished in three primary ways:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"ea24\" id=\"ea24\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Something you know. </strong>This is the most common, and what a password effectively represents. This is the cheapest solution.</li><li name=\"769a\" id=\"769a\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Something you have.</strong> In the real world, this is a physical key or a fob. In the digital world, this is often represented by your mobile phone.</li><li name=\"c589\" id=\"c589\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Something you are. </strong>This is rare, but a common example is a fingerprint or retina scan. Although extremely secure (except in the future that is Minority Report), it\u2019s also the most intrusive and expensive solution and doesn\u2019t really work in the digital world.</li></ol><p name=\"4111\" id=\"4111\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--li\">Given the rarity of #3, let\u2019s disregard.</p><p name=\"22b7\" id=\"22b7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That leaves <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">something you know</em> and <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">something you have</em>. Choosing between the two, the former is more secure because it\u2019s harder to lose or misplace something you know. But the two combined, is extremely secure. This is known as \u201ctwo-factor authentication,\u201d or 2F in short. Gmail <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/180744?hl=en\" data-href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/180744?hl=en\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">offers this</a> and you should enable it immediately. That brings me to my first point.</p><p name=\"3523\" id=\"3523\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Protect your email account at all costs.<br></strong>This is is a single point of failure. Most services don\u2019t offer 2F auth and rely on you creating a password. If you forget that password, the service will likely allow you to reset it via your email address. So if you\u2019re email address is compromised, you\u2019re potentially in for a world of hurt. Make your email password strong and enable 2F authentication.</p><p name=\"121b\" id=\"121b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Don\u2019t share passwords across accounts.</strong><br>Good folks often use the same password for random-new-social-app-they-just-read-about-on-TechCrunch that they use for their most critical services. Do you really trust the junior developer implementing account creation to encrypt and protect your password in their datastore? Or to even prioritize it? Don\u2019t. If someone gets that password and then attempts to re-use it on another service that you shared it with, you\u2019ve been compromised. And oh-dear-god please <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">never re-use your primary email password</strong>.</p><p name=\"f961\" id=\"f961\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Develop your own password generation algorithm.<br></strong>So, your passwords should be strong AND unique, but how will you remember them? There exist solutions to this, such as 1Password, which believes that the most secure password is one that you can\u2019t remember. But, once again, this is a potential single point of failure.</p><p name=\"67c1\" id=\"67c1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Instead, what I do is create a tiny algorithm for generating passwords. For example, say you\u2019re creating a password for two services: Instagram and Vine.<br><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Instagram:</strong> Qfjpin0109$<br><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Vine:</strong> Qfjpvi0109$</p><p name=\"7e61\" id=\"7e61\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In isolation, these look pretty secure. They\u2019re broken up in the following way:<br><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Qfjp:</strong> Random (or not!) string of letters.<br><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">in:</strong> First two letters of the service name.<br><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">0109:</strong> Someone significant\u2019s birthday.<br><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">$:</strong> Punctuation character (if allowed).</p><p name=\"82ff\" id=\"82ff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Of course, given two of these passwords, it\u2019s likely pretty easy for someone to deduce the pattern. But you can take this as far as you like. For example, perhaps if the service ends in a vowel, you swap the random letters and the numbers. Or, instead of the first two letters of the service name, you use the first letter + 1 (so, j instead of i).</p><p name=\"3731\" id=\"3731\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The point is, given only a couple chunks of information to remember (4 letters and a couple rules), you can create a unique and strong password for each service.</p><p name=\"4db3\" id=\"4db3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Oh, and please go enable two-factor authentication for your email accounts.</p></div></div></section><section name=\"532a\" class=\"section section--body section--last\"><div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"6cce\" id=\"6cce\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing\">Love or hate this article?

But shortly after launch, VCs and trusted friends began telling us that we could easily raise at a $40MM valuation. We were floored. Google Ventures was the first to sit us down about raising more money, and the rest followed. We had secured a \u201cparty round\u201d of $8.6MM at a $40MM valuation, with Google Ventures and KPCB to joint-lead.\u00a0</p><p name=\"265f\" id=\"265f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Ready to sign, other term sheets started to flood in, including a couple \u201cblank\u201d term sheets and over 2x the current valuation. I saw two options, A) we could take the smaller offer with the syndicate or B) the higher offer with less dilution from a single investor.\u00a0</p><p name=\"1527\" id=\"1527\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Perhaps it was my naivet\u00e9 (this was my first company), but something didn\u2019t feel right about taking that much of other peoples\u2019 money only weeks after launch and with only two employees. We sought the help of a few trusted mentors (who shall remain anonymous) to help us do the right thing. That included talking to Bill Maris of GV and John Doerr of KPCB. Ultimately, and partially out of loyalty to GV, I decided to go with the more modest amount and option A.</p><h4 name=\"59cb\" id=\"59cb\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">Series B</h4><p name=\"7846\" id=\"7846\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">April\u200a\u2014\u200aSept 2014</strong></p><p name=\"b515\" id=\"b515\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Over these months, we grew the team to over 27 people and experienced exponential international growth (Russia, China, Israel, Brazil, Mexico, Netherlands), at one point we were adding users at a rate of almost 300,000 per day. We scaled, but at a great cost to Google.</p><p name=\"b368\" id=\"b368\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I built the original backend for Secret on Google Cloud Platform (App Engine) because I felt I could design a system that \u201cscaled wide\u201d and optimized for availability at the potential cost in dollars. My thinking was, that if we grew too fast, it was better to solve it with cash than with service disruption (i.e., fail whale). That happened, and we didn\u2019t go down, but we had to raise capital to offset the soaring costs, else we\u2019d be out of business by end of August 2014.\u00a0</p><p name=\"047c\" id=\"047c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There was a lot of interest in a new round, and given our international growth, I was interested in new investors that could help. The goal as always was to not raise too much and not overly dilute the company and employees. Most of the Series A investors who had pro-rata rights, wanted them. So it wasn\u2019t possible for us to bring in the new, strategic investors at the amount they wanted with respect to the valuation. We managed to \u201cnegotiate down\u201d pro-rata rights as far as possible in order to bring in new blood. But eventually, that\u2019s where the idea of doing a \u201csecondary round\u201d was born, a mechanism to bring more investors without diluting the employees, and instead effectively dilute founders by reducing their ownership. This was a trade-off, but the new investors were supportive. We could have continued increasing valuation, or attempting a \u201crolling close\u201d but we wanted to close quickly given the growth curve.  We finalized the terms for the company\u2019s raise of $25MM at a $110MM pre-money valuation.\u00a0</p><p name=\"ec80\" id=\"ec80\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Armed with $35MM total money raised by the company and a rockstar talent, we set out to continue scaling the product and growing the team. We were dedicated, optimistic and grateful for all of the diverse and supportive investors around the table. I couldn\u2019t have been more proud of everyone involved.</p><p name=\"e844\" id=\"e844\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Unfortunately, sometimes not all goes according to plan, and neither money nor talent alone can guarantee success in the end. We know <a href=\"https://medium.com/secret-den/sunset-bc18450478d5\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/secret-den/sunset-bc18450478d5\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">how this story ends</a>, but how we got there from this point, is a very nuanced and interesting story of twists-and-turns to be told another time.</p><p name=\"246a\" id=\"246a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">David Byttow</p></div></div></section>\n</section>\n<footer><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/p/8a555f79f564\">View original.</a></p><p>Exported from <a href=\"https://medium.com\">Medium</a> on January 2, 2021.</p></footer></article></body></html>",
