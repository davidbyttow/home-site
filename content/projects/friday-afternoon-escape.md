A game created for the MiniJam game jam. The theme was "Stealth" and the constraint was "No Violence."

You have to find your backpack and escape in the elevator without being caught by coworkers.

This game is basically inspired by a true story, where I would escape from work to catch the train without getting stopped by coworkers. Also loosely inspired by Office Space. :) It's super short, so enjoy!

Overall, I spent about 12 hours on the project and I created everything from scratch (models, rigs, animation, sounds, level) EXCEPT for the background music which I pulled from YouTube's free audio library.
