A game jam is a contest where participants try to make a video game from scratch. Depending on the format, participants might work independently, or in teams. The contest duration usually ranges from 24 to 72 hours. Participants are generally programmers, game designers, artists, writers, and others in game development-related fields.

In my case, I tend to work alone and prefer 3-day or week-long jams. I often pick a game engine based on the type of game I'd like to build. For 2D games, such as platformers like Cursed Castle, I prefer Unity's sprite toolset. For graphically intense or 3D (especially first-person) games, I might lean toward Unreal Engine. Unreal Engine is generally better out-of-the-box those types of games.

Check out the video below, where I play five games that were submitted to a 3-day game jam.
