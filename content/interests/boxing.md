I took up boxing in the winter of 2014 while working as CEO of Secret. At first, I was drawn by the strength and cardio that it demanded. Physical health just wasn't a priority in my life for the first year of building the company.

I went deeper and trained 4-5x per week across three different gyms in San Francisco: Hit Fit SF, The Park Gym, and K-1. Over the following several years, I lost about 40 pounds (down to 155) and sparred almost every day. My favorite were the smokers (unsanctioned fights) where I'd fight random boxers from around the Bay Area.

I was lucky to be selected to participate in a video with Equinox and Infiniti (see below).
